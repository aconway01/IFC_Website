Chapter History:<br>
The Epsilon Omicron Chapter of Beta Theta Pi at the University of Kentucky 
is proud to be able to finally call ourselves a chapter. Since being re-founded
as a colony at UK in the fall of 2010, we have made many successful strides 
to be recognized within the fraternal community here at the university. After 
nearly three years of hard work, perseverance, and dedication to our organization
in making ourselves known on campus, we fulfilled a list of prerequisites that
allowed us to petition for our charter to be recognized nationally as a chapter
of Beta Theta Pi. We received our charter in the beginning of August 2013 at 
the 174th General Convention held in Charlotte, North Carolina. With 45 representatives,
we appeared with the largest delegation seen at a Beta General Convention in 20 years.
</p>

<p>   
During that time, Beta has established itself on campus through its role in numerous 
philanthropic, service, and social events. For the past three years in a row, Beta has 
placed first in the fraternity division for Greek Sing, UK's largest philanthropic event.
Beta worked with Kappa Delta sorority in organizing and hosting the first greek 
cheerleading event, Beta/KD Bring It On, raising nearly $9,000 overall, with over $6,000
benefiting domestic abuse prevention in Lexington. In addition, Beta has a strong 
representation in campus intramurals, with brothers participating in nearly every sport,
as well as numerous campus leaders.
</p>

<p>    
Beta Theta Pi has also worked to extend its service and its impact beyond the borders 
of UK's campus. In 2011, the fraternity teamed up with the International Book Project 
in Lexington to help sort, package, and ship thousands of books to underprivileged areas
across the world.
</p>

<p>
Staying true to the core value of intellectual growth and academic achievement, the 
brothers of Beta Theta Pi push each other to excel in school. As a result, Beta achieved
the highest GPA amongst all fraternities on campus in 2011 and the fall of 2012. The
members of Beta are very diverse in their academic pursuits, but each works hard and 
has the support of his brothers in reaching each of his goals.
</p>

<p>    
At the annual Greek Awards, UK Beta took home five awards. Not only did they claim three
out of the four GPA awards (Highest Pledge Class GPA, Highest Standing Member GPA and 
Highest Combined GPA), but they also received the Violence Intervention and Prevention 
Award, which had never been won by a fraternity before. The highlight of the night came 
when Beta was honored with the Fraternity Dean's Cup, the highest award offered to any 
fraternity on campus.
</p>

<p>    
The future of Beta Theta Pi at the University of Kentucky is bright. The brotherhood 
is strong, and grows stronger by the day. The fraternity looks forward to continuing to
have a positive impact on campus and in the community while developing each of its 
members into better leaders.
</p>

<p>
Philanthropy events:<br>
 Semi-annual International Book Project community service event - Prepare shipments for 
shipping overseas to third world countries in order to promote literacy rates and 
intellectual equality. Both occasions have recorded an outstanding 100% chapter attendance.
<br><br>
Bring-it-on 2012 - Raising over $6,000 for domestic abuse prevention, the brothers
of Beta Theta Pi and the sisters of Kappa Delta teamed up to host the first Beta Bring 
It On. The event was a cheerleading competition that paired sororities and fraternities, 
all wrapped up with a final show performed by the 19-time champion UK Cheerleaders.

National History:<br>
       
Beta Theta Pi was founded in 1839 at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. <br><br>
          
In the 174 years of the fraternity, over 183,000 members have been initiated worldwide, 
with over 5,800 active undergraduates. <br><br>
         
Notable alumni of Beta Theta Pi include Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, legendary basketball
coach John Wooden, several United States Congressmen, and numerous CEOs of high profile 
companies. <br><br>
          
In 1998, Beta Theta Pi launched the Men of Principle initiative which focuses on building
each man into a greater leader, capable of exemplifying the strong values of the fraternity.
</p>

<p>
Our Mission:<br>
Beta Theta Pi is dedicated to building men of principle for a principled life. Our

institution through lifelong devotion to intellectual excellence, high standards of 
moral conduct and responsible citizenship

With the Men of Principle initiative, Beta Theta Pi gives a new voice to the enduring 
values of our Fraternity. We offer a membership experience that is unique - calling on 
men to become leaders and giving them the tools they need to do so.
</p>

<p>
